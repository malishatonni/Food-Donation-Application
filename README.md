# Food-Donation-Application
Our Food Donation android based mobile application named "AHAR-আহার” is a mission to end hunger and no wasting of food to make a hungry-free world. Our mobile application aims to bring about transparency, clarity, and swiftness in the process of donation. We are developing an application through which a person can donate food based on his or her ability, while will send request to collect the food to the organizations or NGO's and they can accept the request and collect the food and distribute among needy people. The donor can also select any specific organization to donate. This will build a network bridge among donors and NGO's to create a healthy hungry free society.
